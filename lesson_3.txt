1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on two or more computers is a necessity or just to have a backup or even when there's need of other contributors to follow along.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reason you make commitments and don't have it automatically made.
